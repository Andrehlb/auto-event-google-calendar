# auto-event-google-calendar
The project aims to automate event creation in Google Calendar from information found on web pages. Using Python and Google Calendar API, the system detects event details (like date and time), extracts them, and schedules events automatically. This eliminates manual input, enhancing time management and daily organization efficiency.
